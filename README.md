## Theme Park Map Builder - Group Project
As a team we created an interactive grid map of Magic Kingdom. The park includes different areas with attractions and events. When you visit the page all of the attractions and events that are currently showing will be shown on the left. 

If you are interested in knowing what shows and attractions are playing during a specific hour, select a time in the dropdown menu and the shows will appear on the left. You can click on the attraction names to view the attraction description.

If you are searching for a specific attraction, simply input key words into the search bar. A border will appear around the area that the attraction is in.
